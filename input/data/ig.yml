    description: The US Core Advance Directive Information (ADI) DocumentReference
      Profile inherits from the FHIR [DocumentReference](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/documentreference.html)
      resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. It sets minimum expectations
      for searching and fetching patient Advance Directive Information (ADI) documents
      using the DocumentReference resource. Examples of advance healthcare directive
      documents include physician order for life sustaining treatment (POLST), do
      not resuscitate order (DNR), and medical power of attorney. In addition to the
      document contents, it communicates the type of advance directive document, the
      author, the verifier, and other properties. To represent whether advance directive
      documents exist for a patient, see the [US Core Observation ADI Documentation
      Profile](StructureDefinition-us-core-observation-adi-documentation.html). To
      represent orders based on an individual's Portable Medical Order (PMO), see
      the [US Core PMO ServiceRequest Profile](StructureDefinition-us-core-pmo-servicerequest.html).
      This profile sets minimum expectations for searching and fetching patient ADI
      documents using the DocumentReference resource. It specifies which core elements,
      extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and constrains
      how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for
      specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption.

      and plan of treatment data associated with a patient. It specifies which core
      elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present and

      expectations for the CareTeam resource for identifying the Care Team members
      associated with a patient to promote interoperability and adoption through common
      implementation. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies,

      of measure. It specifies which *additional*  core elements, extensions,  vocabularies,
