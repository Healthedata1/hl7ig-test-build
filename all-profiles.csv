Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians might not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term ""allergy"" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of ""intolerance"" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts might not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.","","","","","","","","",,"required","Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for a Reaction Risk.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/allergy-intolerance-type|4.0.1","",,,,"AllergyIntolerance.type",0,1,"","ele-1:All FHIR elements must have a @value or children {hasValue() or (children().count() > id.count())}

","Code that identifies the allergy or intolerance","Code for an allergy or intolerance statement (either a positive or a negated/excluded statement).  This may be a code for a substance or pharmaceutical product that is considered to be responsible for the adverse reaction risk (e.g., ""Latex""), an allergy or intolerance condition (e.g., ""Latex allergy""), or a negated/excluded code for a specific substance or class (e.g., ""No latex allergy"") or a general or categorical negated statement (e.g.,  ""No known allergy"", ""No known drug allergies"").  Note: the substance for a specific reaction may be different from the substance identified as the cause of the risk, but it must be consistent with it. For instance, it may be a more specific substance (e.g. a brand medication) or a composite product that includes the identified substance. It must be clinically safe to only process the 'code' and ignore the 'reaction.substance'.  If a receiving system is unable to confirm that AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance falls within the semantic scope of AllergyIntolerance.code, then the receiving system should ignore AllergyIntolerance.reaction.substance.","It is strongly recommended that this element be populated using a terminology, where possible. For example, some terminologies used include RxNorm, SNOMED CT, DM+D, NDFRT, ICD-9, IDC-10, UNII, and ATC. Plain text should only be used if there is no appropriate terminology available. Additional details can be specified in the text.When a substance or product code is specified for the 'code' element, the ""default"" semantic context is that this is a positive statement of an allergy or intolerance (depending on the value of the 'type' element, if present) condition to the specified substance/product.  In the corresponding SNOMED CT allergy model, the specified substance/product is the target (destination) of the ""Causative agent"" relationship.The 'substanceExposureRisk' extension is available as a structured and more flexible alternative to the 'code' element for making positive or negative allergy or intolerance statements.  This extension provides the capability to make ""no known allergy"" (or ""no risk of adverse reaction"") statements regarding any coded substance/product (including cases when a pre-coordinated ""no allergy to x"" concept for that substance/product does not exist).

The use of extensions is what allows the FHIR specification to retain a core level of simplicity for everyone.","Modifier extensions allow for extensions that *cannot* be safely ignored to be clearly distinguished from the vast majority of extensions which can be safely ignored.  This promotes interoperability by eliminating the need for implementers to prohibit the presence of extensions.
