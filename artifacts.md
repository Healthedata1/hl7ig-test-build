## Artifacts Summary

This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts defined as part of this implementation guide.

### Behavior: Capability Statements 

The following artifacts define the specific capabilities that different types of systems are expected to have in order to comply with this implementation guide. Systems conforming to this implementation guide are expected to declare conformance to one or more of the following capability statements.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [US Core Client CapabilityStatement Liquid Rendered](CapabilityStatement-us-core-client-liquid.md) | This Section describes the expected capabilities of the US Core Client which is responsible for creating and initiating the queries for information about an individual patient. The complete list of FHIR profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters supported by US Core Servers are defined in the[Conformance Requirements for Server](CapabilityStatement-us-core-server.md). US Core Clients have the option of choosing from this list to access necessary data based on their local use cases and other contextual requirements. |
| [US Core Server CapabilityStatement Liquid Rendered](CapabilityStatement-us-core-server-liquid.md) | This Section describes the expected capabilities of the US Core Server actor which is responsible for providing responses to the queries submitted by the US Core Requestors. The complete list of FHIR profiles, RESTful operations, and search parameters supported by US Core Servers are defined. Systems implementing this capability statement should meet the ASTP 2015 Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS) access requirement for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7) and Application Access - Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8) and the ASTP[U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 6 July 2025](https://www.healthit.gov/isp/sites/isp/files/2025-07/USCDI-Version-6-July-2025.pdf). |

### Behavior: Search Parameters 

These define the properties by which a RESTful server can be searched. They can also be used for sorting and including related resources.

### Structures: Resource Profiles 

These define constraints on FHIR resources for systems conforming to this implementation guide.

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [US Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Laboratory Results Reporting](StructureDefinition-us-core-diagnosticreport-lab.md) | The US Core DiagnosticReport Profile for Laboratory Results Reporting inherits from the FHIR[DiagnosticReport](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/diagnosticreport.html)resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. Laboratory results are grouped and summarized using the DiagnosticReport resource, which typically references Observation resource(s). Each Observation resource represents an individual laboratory test and result value or component result values or a nested panel (such as a microbial susceptibility panel) that references other observations. Laboratory results can also be presented in report form or as free text. This profile sets minimum expectations for the DiagnosticReport resource to record, search, and fetch laboratory results associated with a patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets**SHALL**be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption. |
| [US Core Patient Profile](StructureDefinition-us-core-patient.md) | The US Core Patient Profile inherits from the FHIR[Patient](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/patient.html)resource; refer to it for scope and usage definitions. This profile meets the requirements of the[U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isp/united-states-core-data-interoperability-uscdi)**Patient Demographics/Information**Data Class. It sets minimum expectations for the Patient resource to record, search, and fetch basic demographics and other administrative information about an individual patient. It specifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets**SHALL**be present and constrains how the elements are used. Providing the floor for standards development for specific use cases promotes interoperability and adoption. |
